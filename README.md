# QUIZ

## Decription
For this project, I made a code quiz game which has a timer, records the players' score, and lists out previously recordrd scores. Additionally I made the application subtract time for each incorrect answer. The most dificult part for me in ths project was correct "punctuation". I would have most of the code correct but forget a semi colon or a bracket and spend a majoity of the time trying to find it. This project has made me more aware of properly closing statements and correct capitalization. I used a bootstrap template for the theme of the page and had to trim down unessesary code. which adjusting code to what I needed.
